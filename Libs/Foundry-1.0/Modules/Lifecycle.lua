-- Foundry.Lifecycle
--
-- The AceAddon-3.0 replacement: addon-object creation plus correctly-timed
-- startup callbacks. A single Foundry-private dispatcher frame owns the three
-- core WoW startup signals (ADDON_LOADED / PLAYER_LOGIN / PLAYER_LOGOUT), plus
-- ADDONS_UNLOADING where the client validates it, once for the
-- whole library; per-owner controllers subscribe to phase hooks over it. This
-- keeps 100+ consumers O(1) per startup signal (ADDON_LOADED is demuxed by
-- addon name, never a wake-up storm). The native dispatcher frame stays
-- reachable underneath via :GetNativeHandles().
--
-- Four HONEST raw-signal hooks, named after the WoW events they bridge:
-- :OnAddonLoaded, :OnLogin, :OnUnloading, :OnLogout. OnUnloading is available
-- only where ADDONS_UNLOADING is a valid client event; it does not promise an
-- ordering relation with PLAYER_LOGOUT. There is deliberately no "ready" hook
-- (DB loaded + defaults + migrations) -- that guarantee cannot be true until
-- Foundry.DB lands; naming one now would imply a guarantee not yet carried.
--
-- addon-loaded can wait: on some clients, ADDON_LOADED (and even
-- PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD) can fire before the client has resolved the
-- player's own name and realm -- a fresh client session logs in with the
-- character's identity still unresolved for a moment. A controller that
-- reaches ADDON_LOADED while that identity is unresolved is held rather than
-- fired; it releases (addon-loaded, then login if login already fired) the
-- moment the name and realm are known, so a consumer that constructs its
-- database in the addon-loaded hook, as the docs direct, never gets handed a
-- refused construction over a placeholder name. Where identity is already
-- known at ADDON_LOADED -- every case but a cold login and, on a client with
-- region-wide unique names, a character the client reports without a
-- surname -- nothing is held, no extra events are registered, and no timer
-- runs.
--
-- On a client with region-wide unique names (Forever), a character's identity
-- is first name plus surname rather than first name plus realm, and the same
-- hold covers an unresolved surname exactly as it covers an unresolved name
-- or realm. A surname that never arrives is capped, not open-ended: the poll
-- below settles it after its first tick, and the held controller releases
-- under the character's first name alone. Foundry.DB owns what that means for
-- the character's saved-data key; this module only owns the wait.
